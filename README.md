# Abstract

Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform offer a lot of productivity and flexibility around targeting the broad set of devices that run Windows. As a developer, you have a lot of choice–from building a single binary that is identical on all devices, through to an app that adapts to the type of device and on to the point of building an entirely different app for each class of device. What's the right thing to do? How should you think about building the "One App to Rule Them All?" What are the design and implementation trade-offs you need to consider? This session dives into these areas with a hands-on approach and shows what it really means to be building apps across families of Windows devices that have different capabilities. We will also talk about bridges (and especially the iOS Bridge to Windows 10), and new platforms such as Continuum and HoloLens (with live demos).
